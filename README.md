Study the scenario and complete the questions that follow:



An Array of Billtong (Weights)


In an effort to buying Billtong at a Pick n Pay retail store, you were presented with 8 biltong pack with their respective weights as follows:

·         Pack 1 = 20kg

·         Pack 2 = 12kg

·         Pack 3 = 7kg

·         Pack 4 = 22kg

·         Pack 5 = 15kg

·         Pack 6 = 26kg

·         Pack 7 = 18kg

·         Pack 8 = 120kg

If the biltongs packs are arranged in an array-like structure such that the pack numbers correspond with the position of the billtongs while the weight represent the respective array values (biltong 1 assumes the first position in the array with an array value of 20 while biltong 8 assumes the last position with an array value of 120).
